How to Use Git in a Simple Way

1. Start by pulling from main**:
   Always begin by pulling the latest changes from the main branch to ensure your local repository is up to date.

   git checkout main

   git pull

2. Switch to your own branch:
   After pulling the latest changes, switch to your own branch. If you don't have a branch yet, create one.

   git checkout -b my-branch  # For creating a new branch
   # or
   git checkout my-branch  # For switching to an existing branch

3. Merge main into your branch:
   Ensure your branch has the latest changes from main by merging main into your branch.

   git merge main

4. Edit and commit your changes:
   Make your changes to the code, then stage and commit them.
   
   git add .

   git commit -m "Describe your changes"

5. Push your changes to the remote branch:
   Push your committed changes to the remote repository.

   git push

6. Switch back to main and pull again:
   Go back to the main branch and pull the latest changes again to ensure itâ€™s up to date.

   git checkout main

   git pull

7. Switch back to your branch and merge main:
   Go back to your branch and merge the latest changes from main into it.

   git checkout my-branch

   git merge main       (Step 4 (commit) is needed for the merge to function correctly)



8. Merge your branch into main and push:
   Finally, switch to the main branch, merge your branch into main, and push the changes.
   
   git checkout main
   
   git merge my-branch
   
   git push
   

Following these steps will help ensure that your branch is always in sync with the main branch and that your changes are correctly integrated into the main branch.
